Exercises for data structures and fundamentals

This project contains multiple exercises done by me to gain a better understanding of data structures and fundamentals of programming. Most of these are a simple rewrite of the standard library, but some of them are also here to add functionality and improve on efficiency for optimized perfomances. Most optimizations are better memory management and less CPU cycles.
